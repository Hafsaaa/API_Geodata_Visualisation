# Description

An interesting assignment which greatly showcases API data extraction and visualisation using Python; and more specifically the Folium visualization Library.

The goal of the assignment is to extract then visualize deeply nested Json geographical data about Estates using a public API: http://api.whise.eu/Systemintegrator.html
The Geographical data is to be shown in a Folium map; a Python library mostly used for map visualisations.

We will then show in the legend of each plotted location, the three nearest locations using nested Json data extracted from another API : https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api-reference/venues/explore/

# Requirements 

All the code is written in Python 3.

The provided notebook can be used in Jupyter Notebook, requiring the installation of the 'Requests' module for HTTP coomunication with the APIs, and the 'Folium' module for geo graphical visualisation.

Alternatively, you can use Google Colab to have a ready to use online environment with all libraries preloaded.


# Usage

The latest execution results are already cached in the notebook.

If you wish to rerun the notebook to tweak the parameters of the different models used simply launch it in Jupyter or Colab. Beware that the cached execution results will be lost.
